I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Birmingham, expecting to graduate in 2025. My current research centres on empirical analysis of imperfect knowledge in Macro and Finance, with a specific emphasis on macroeconomic policy making. I am also interested in the formation and learning of expectations among enterprises and households.
